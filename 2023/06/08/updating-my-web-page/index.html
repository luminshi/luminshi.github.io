  <h1>Updating my web page</h1>

  <p>My GitHub page’s latest update was made in March 2021, whoops.
Obviously, the page needs a much-needed update; you are looking at it now. This post is a quick update about me.</p>

<p>So, I completed graduate school in Oregon early last year.
I am currently a systems engineer in Cloudflare’s traffic engineering team.
It has been an excellent experience for me so far. I appreciate that:
1) I have friendly and competent colleagues, and
2) I get to work on interesting problems that can positively affect a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network/">large network</a> on the Internet.</p>

<p>Apart from my work life, my wife and I are settling in the same city after many years of a long-distance relationship!</p>

<p>With the above, I conclude my first post on my updated website. XD</p>
